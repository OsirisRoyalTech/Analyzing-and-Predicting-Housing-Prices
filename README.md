# Real World Data Analyst Project: Analyzing and Predicting Housing Prices
In this project, we are tasked with analyzing housing prices from a dataset that includes various features of homes. Our goal is to build a model that can predict housing prices based on these features. The dataset is typically structured with features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location, as well as the target variable, which is the price of the house.

This project will involve:
1.	Data Exploration – Understanding the dataset.
2.	Data Preprocessing – Cleaning the data and handling missing values.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying patterns and correlations.
4.	Feature Engineering – Creating new features or transforming existing ones.
5.	Model Building – Creating a predictive model using machine learning techniques.
6.	Model Evaluation – Assessing the performance of the model.
7.	Final Conclusion – Interpreting the results and making recommendations.

Let's use a real-world dataset like the Boston Housing Dataset, which is available in the sklearn library, or you can use a similar dataset (e.g., Kaggle's housing dataset).

# Conclusion
This project demonstrated a basic data analysis workflow involving the analysis and prediction of housing prices. The steps included data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
