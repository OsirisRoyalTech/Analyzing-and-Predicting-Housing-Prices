1.	Model Tuning: We could apply GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for better performance.
2.	Feature Engineering: Experiment with more complex feature transformations (e.g., logarithmic transformations for skewed features).
3.	Other Models: We could explore other models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
4.	Cross-validation: Apply cross-validation techniques to avoid overfitting.
